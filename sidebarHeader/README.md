# WHATSAPP_CLONE

This is a collaborative project for the ADA Software Engineering Internship.

This is a WhatsApp clone project by "Team Dalmatians" of the Web-Frontend track.

## Overview

For this project, I worked on the Sidebar header of the WhatsApp clone-this project was created using just HTML and CSS.

There are two sections to the Sidebar header, let's name them:
-The top Header Section
-The Search Section

### The Top Header Section

This section showcases the user's profile image at the left hand side on the section, and on the right hand side:a status updates icon; a new chat icon; and an icon for a dropdown menu.

I was able to created this section's layout using **HTML tags** like: <section>, <div>, <img> and **CSS formats** like flexbox, width and height styling, paddings, margins, background color. etc.
The icons and profile avatar were downloaded off the internet.

### The Search Section

This section showcases a input search box and an icon to filter messages.

Here I made use of the HTML input field for the search box and positioned it and the filter icon side by side using the CSS Flexbox property.

Below is an image showing the result of my code on my dektop:
